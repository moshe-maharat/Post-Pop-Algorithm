# Post-Pop-Algorithm
Nowadays, many companies and businesses have realized the marketing potential of social media and the great business value of their success in that field. Therefore, in this project I have developed an algorithm whose purpose is to predict the popularity of posts on in social media. My prediction includes time series forecasting which is a sequence of observations estimated one after the other, at a given time interval. This algorithm can generate profits for companies due to the fact that they can make business and financial conclusions and plan their strategy and campaign properly.
